# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to implement comprehensive test coverage for the Azure DevOps MCP server project. Currently, the project lacks any automated tests despite having testing infrastructure mentioned in the contributing guidelines. Adding robust test coverage will improve code reliability, facilitate safer refactoring, enable confident feature additions, and provide better documentation of expected behavior through test cases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the project, I want comprehensive unit tests for all core functionality, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN all client classes SHALL have unit tests covering their public methods
2. WHEN the test suite runs THEN all tool implementations SHALL have unit tests covering success and error scenarios
3. WHEN the test suite runs THEN all utility functions SHALL have unit tests covering edge cases and error conditions
4. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the test coverage SHALL be at least 80% for all source files
5. WHEN a developer runs tests THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds for the full suite

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on Azure DevOps API integration, I want mocked API responses for testing, so that tests can run without requiring actual Azure DevOps credentials or network access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL NOT make actual HTTP requests to Azure DevOps APIs
2. WHEN testing API clients THEN mock responses SHALL accurately represent real Azure DevOps API responses
3. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN mock responses SHALL simulate various Azure DevOps API error conditions
4. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL be deterministic and not depend on external services
5. IF Azure DevOps API responses change THEN mock data SHALL be easily updatable

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want integration tests for the MCP server functionality, so that I can verify the complete request-response flow works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL test the complete MCP tool execution flow
2. WHEN a tool is called through MCP THEN the integration test SHALL verify the correct response format
3. WHEN testing tool registration THEN all tools SHALL be properly registered and discoverable
4. WHEN testing server initialization THEN the server SHALL start and respond to MCP protocol messages
5. WHEN testing configuration THEN invalid configurations SHALL be properly rejected

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer running tests locally, I want a simple and fast test execution experience, so that I can quickly validate my changes during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer runs `npm test` THEN all tests SHALL execute and provide clear output
2. WHEN tests fail THEN error messages SHALL clearly indicate what went wrong and where
3. WHEN running tests in watch mode THEN only affected tests SHALL re-run on file changes
4. WHEN generating coverage reports THEN they SHALL be in both terminal and HTML formats
5. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL clean up any temporary files or resources created

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a CI/CD pipeline, I want automated test execution with proper reporting, so that pull requests can be automatically validated before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI runs tests THEN they SHALL produce JUnit XML output for integration with CI systems
2. WHEN tests fail in CI THEN the build SHALL fail with a non-zero exit code
3. WHEN coverage drops below threshold THEN the CI build SHALL fail
4. WHEN tests run in CI THEN they SHALL complete within 2 minutes
5. WHEN generating coverage reports THEN they SHALL be uploadable to coverage tracking services
